# Content for class 3. 

Class presentation materials are on [Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J0TGZN3XRQw89S1f2ugrPw9jdVIisQeT?usp=sharing).

## Homework

### For your class journal (2 points each):

**Intro to interactivity**

* What are some strategies interactive map developers can use to ensure maps with a lot of interactions are not overwhelming?
* Why do we use the term “map user” instead of “map reader?”

**Common types of interaction**

* What is geocoding and how might you add it to an interactive map?

**Intro to events**

* What is an event?
* Describe an example of how you could use an event listener with an interactive map.


### Code exercises to do on your own (10 points each):

* Starting from your marker-and-popup map, add a button that, when clicked, causes the map to fly to Walla Walla, Washington. To turn this assignment in, commit a new file called "fly-to.html" to the "class 3" folder in your personal class repo.
  * [Hint](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp)
* Create popups that include information about the clicked feature. Starting from [this starter file](https://github.com/mapbox/web-mapping-curriculum/blob/master/class-3/homework-starter.html), attempt to address each of the `[Prompt]` comments, including any sub-prompts that follow. Once you have made your edits, save your changes and commit the file to your personal class repo. This will be a challenging exercise and we don't expect everyone to build a completely working map. For any prompts you get stuck on, you can still get full credit by including, at a minimum: 
  * Pseudo code describing what you think needs to happen.
  * At least one code snippet showing what you attempted.
  * Links to any resources you found while researching.

## Project
By now you should have a project proposal that includes your topic, a description of your audience, and some idea of the data you’ll be using.

This week, you should prepare your first progress report. This is a minimal check-in that should include, at a minimum:
* What you worked on.
* Any changes you’ve made to your original proposal.
* A description of what you’ve built so far and, if applicable, a link to code (it’s ok if it doesn’t work!)
* Any obstacles you need to overcome before you can move on to the next step.

**How to turn in your progress report**:
Open an issue in your forked version of the class repo. The issue title should start with “[Progress report]” to let us know that it’s a progress report. 

Include all of the bullets to the left (feel free to say “not applicable” if needed) and any relevant links to code, data, or resources.
